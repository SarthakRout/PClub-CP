# Ashwamedha Yajna
In the ancient times, the glorious kings of Bharat performed many rituals for prosperity of their kingdoms , good-will of their family, or to please the priests so that they would grant some boon.  
In the Ashwamedha Yajna, the horse is left free in the Ishanya(North-East) direction with the army of the King. Whichever the kingdom the horse steps on, the king of that kingdom must either accept lordship of the King or fight to protect their kingdom. This ritual is symbolises that the King is unchallenged in the whole world.  
It was said that whoever conducted 100 Ashwamedha Yajna would be known as King of Gods. So, naturally Indra(with the help of other gods) always tried to hinder the Yajna.  
You are Chakrabarti Samrat Sarthak Rout.  
You have conducted Ashwamedha Yajna successfully 99 times. For the 100th time, Indra has decided to not let you win. He has placed some of his own soldiers in your path. Only that army will win whose total strength is strictly more. (Atleast one soldier should remain standing to claim that land).   
You are given an array denoting the area to be captured. Each unit box has equal unit area. Your horse is present at the bottom left position and will step into the bottom leftmost position. The horse can only move in North or East direction. You can move until you are dead or you reach the topmost right corner signifying the end of land.
